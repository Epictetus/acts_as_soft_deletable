=== acts_as_soft_deletable ===

This plugin provides the ability to soft delete ActiveRecord models. When 
models are destroyed, they will be archived into a special deleted table. 
They can later be restored easily.

<pre>

class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
  # This will wrap the destroy method to provide soft delete 
  # support and create a new ActiveRecord class called Artist::Deleted
  acts_as_soft_deletable
end

model = Artist.find(34)
model.destroy   # removes row from artists table, and adds a row to 
                # deleted_artists table

deleted = Artist::Deleted.find(34)
deleted.undestroy!  # adds the row back to the artists table, and removes 
                    # if from the deleted_artists table

restored = Artist.find(34) # The artist is restored with all the same 
                           # information. The updated_at column will be 
                           # Time.now if it exists.

</pre>

=== Compare to acts_as_paranoid ===

Acts_as_paranoid takes the approach of using a deleted_at flag in the models table. This has the drawback that finds on the model have to exclude deleted rows. This behaviour change turns out be be a challenge. Acts_as_paranoid tries to patch the ActiveRecord internals to accomplish this, but ActiveRecord could change in the future causing acts_as_parnoid to break. Also, there are some exotic finds that need to be considered like "has_many through with polymorphism". This doesn't exclude deleted models as it should in acts_as_paranoid (March 2008).

This plugin avoids the problem of changing find's behavior by allowing the row to really be 
deleted and archiving it into another table. The advantages are that its hook into ActiveRecord is really simple and has low risk of breaking in the future. The cost is that there are a bunch of deleted tables in the database that need to be maintained. For example, if the table adds a column in a future migration, then the deleted table needs that column as well.

This turns out to be easy to solve. A migration helper is available (see below) that will help keep the deleted table in sync. Also, a unit test helper is provided (again, see below) which adds unit tests to the model ensuring soft delete is working. If this is used, the test will fail if the deleted table gets out of sync.

=== Setup ===

Any ActiveRecord class that wants the soft delete functionality should add
the following line to their class definition:

<pre>
class SomeModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_soft_deletable
  ...
</pre>

and setup the deleted table with the following migration:

<pre>
class AddActsAsSoftDeletable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    SomeModel::Deleted.create_table
  end

  def self.down
    SomeModel::Deleted.drop_table
  end
end
</pre>

=== TODO ===

make undestroying easier when there are lots of related rows to undestroy.
