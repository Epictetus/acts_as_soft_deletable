== Creating the test database(s)

The tests can run against several databases. See the related test/connections/#{adapter}/connection.rb file
for information about expected connection settings.

== Other Prerequisites

Mocha must be installed.

== Running with Rake

rake test       # runs tests against all databases
rake test:mysql # just runs mysql tests

rake -T   # See this for more info
