== Creating the test database(s)

The tests can run against several databases. See the related test/connections/#{adapter}/connection.rb file
for information about expected connection settings.

== Other Prerequisites

Mocha must be installed.

== Running with Rake

rake test # runs mysql tests by default
rake test DB=sqlite3 # runs sqlite3 tests, see test/config.yml for other database options
